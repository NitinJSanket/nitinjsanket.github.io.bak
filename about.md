Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. Student in the <a href="zz">Perception and Robotics Group</a> (PRG) at the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland, College Park</a> (UMD), advised by <a href="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~yiannis/">Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos</a> and <a href="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~fer/">Dr. Cornelia Fermuller</a>. PRG is associated with the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu">University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies
</a> (UMIACS) and <a href="http://arclab.isr.umd.edu/">Autonomy, Robotics and Cognition Lab</a> (ARC). My research interests are applying deep learning on quadrotors to enhance their navigational capabilities.

I'm originally from <a href="/https://goo.gl/ckweVQ">Bengaluru, India</a>. Prior to joining UMD, I did my Masters in Robotics at  <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. At UPenn, I worked in the  <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception Laboratory </a> (GRASP) and was advised by <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/">Prof. Kostas Daniilidis</a>. Before joining UPenn, I did my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering at <a href="hhttp://www.msrit.edu/">KM. S. Ramaiah Institude of Technology</a> where I worked with Prof. K. Manikantan.
